# LabNotebook

The idea is to help students learn how to take effective notes, and for the student to leave the course with something that will help them use Julia/Jupyter in other courses in following semesters. Also, to give them a sense of this-is-what-I-did-this-semester accomplishment.

Contents:

   * Checklist of things to do on first day
   * a chapter for each of the 10 homework sets
   * a page for each problem in WeBWorK for students to record who what when where why
   * a "typical" problem with solution for each chapter (but really only the first 5)
   * an appendix with Julia functions (made by Claude AI, and I haven't checked that these are all actual functions)
   * an appendix with examples of SymPy functionality (also from Claude)
   * an appendix with an old "extra credit" assignment on using Jupyter
